A big thank you to Microsoft for their kind invitation to speak at Future Decoded 2017 in London!

Myself and [Mark Nash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-nash/) delivered this session in September, but unfortunately it was not recorded.

I have created a screencast of the session, which has been uploaded to Youtube.

If you're interested in helping your powershell scale through quality testing, then I'd recommend you watch the screencast.
