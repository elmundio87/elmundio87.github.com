It's been quite a while since I last did a blog post!

I'm just writing this to test out an IFTTT applet I've made that hooks into the site [feed.xml](feed.xml) and posts to Twitter.

I will resolve to post more here, as I'm sure there's interesting stuff I've been working with for the last 6 months that I just haven't put the time into documentating.

I'm hoping to do a piece on Policy as Code (extending past the Terraform Validate stuff) and something about my experiences with the [Amazon Server Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/) and how to best use it (and avoid some non-obvious pitfalls).

Watch this space!
